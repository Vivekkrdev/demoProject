I made this project for my Future Ready Talent internship in Microsoft Azure.

1. INDUSTRY : Health


2. PROJECT TITLE : A health bot about general medicines, symptoms, precautions and cures

3. PROBLEM STATEMENT/OPPORTUNITY: 
Many peoples don't know about which medicine is best for their illness and that caused 
they have to go to the doctor even for a general illness like fever, tiredness and headache. 
But it can be easy if they can get their cure online by giving the details of thier symptoms.


 ATTRACT THE RIGHT CLIENTS:

 With the right product selection, branding and marketing message, the ideal clients can visit the organisation 
    portfolio website and feel at home. The ideal client will immediately recognize themselves in your description, 
    clearly understand your services and feel confident that you are the perfect for their business. Most clients are 
    not looking for a faceless and nameless brand to develop patterns and to prepare work for production. Most clients 
    are looking for a partner they can trust and work with for years to come.

 KNOW YOUR CUSTOMERS:

 One of the key benefits of having a portfolio website is that it allows you to have more direct contact with potential 
    clients and visitors to your site. Free tools such as Google Analytics allow you to see where your website visitors are 
    coming from, how they are finding you, and what parts of your website they are spending the most time on.

 YOUR MARKETING HUB:
	
    With so many different ways to sell and market product and services including online networks and physical networks,
 it is imperative to make your website your marketing hub, the one place potential clients can go to learn more about 
    product and services whether online or offline. The portfolio website provides an opportunity to explain your business 
    model and services. Furthermore, potential clients can find all the social media links they may need on your website.

 MAKE SURE YOU ARE MAXIMIZING YOUR POTENTIAL:

 A portfolio website is so much more than a website where you present your work. The website is a channel to explain 
    about achievements and welcome new contacts and clients to your client base. The website design should consider how the 
    organisation can develop a more inviting environment to new clients, clearly explain product and services. Itâ€™s a great 
    business building strategy and wonderful way to develop long lasting relationships with clients.
